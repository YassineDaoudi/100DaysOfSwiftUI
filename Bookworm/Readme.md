**in this project we have learned about:**

- Creating a custom component with @Binding.
- Accepting multi-line text input with TextEditor.
- How to combine Core Data and SwiftUI.
- Creating books with Core Data.
- Adding a custom star rating component.
- Building a list with @FetchRequest.
- Showing book details.
- Sorting fetch requests with SortDescriptor.
- Deleting from a Core Data fetch request.
- Using an alert to pop a NavigationLink programmatically.

I will be adding screenshots soon.
